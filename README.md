The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) provides a rich dataset of astronomical observations that can be used for a variety of
scientific investigations, including the classification of celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and quasars. In order to extract
meaningful insights from this data, machine learning models can be trained to classify objects based on their spectral properties. This
project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify objects in the SDSS dataset. The model will be trained on a subset of the
data, using a supervised learning approach that involves feeding labeled examples into the model and adjusting its parameters to
minimize the classification error. Once the model has been trained, it will be evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance
on unseen data. The classification task will involve identifying stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral features. The model
will be designed to extract relevant features from the spectra, such as the presence or absence of certain emission or absorption lines.
These features will then be used as input to the model, which will output a prediction of the object’s class. The success of the model
will depend on several factors, including the quality of the input data, the choice of model architecture and hyperparameters, and the
size of the training dataset. In order to optimize the model’s performance, various techniques such as data augmentation,
regularization, and hyperparameter tuning will be employed. Overall, the goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that
can effectively classify objects in the SDSS dataset. Such a model could have important applications in astronomy, enabling
researchers to better understand the properties and evolution of celestial objects across the universe.
